## travian-helper-extension
A [WebExtension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) which makes the game comfortable.

The extension is under development, it can be buggy. It was tested only under macOS+Chrome.

Use it at your own risk, you can be banned from server! [Rules](http://t4.answers.travian.com/?aid=103#bot).

[![Chrome web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/images/ChromeWebStore_BadgeWBorder_v2_206x58.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/travian-helper-t4/loilgfpgpjjfobfclnhemcafjemheebl)

Currently working parts:
- **attack detection** The extension will continuously reload travian in background at random time (default is 2-5min). If someone is attacking you, you will get a notification, or alarm sound, or both.🚨🔊
- **auto re-login** Sometimes the game logs out. Extension will log back into the game, and it will continue to watching for attacks.
- **hide unnecessary stuffs** The extension can hide site elements and icons which you can't use without gold.
